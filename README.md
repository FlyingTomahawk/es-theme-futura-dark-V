Notes
-----

- This theme was build on a 1080p (1920x1080) resolution and is best used on a 16:9 Full HD TV. 
- This theme might not look good on smaller/larger screens or 4:3 aspect ratio monitors/TVs.
- I just used random screenshots for the system view. You can replace those if you like by using the PSD files inside the "Screenshot cutting layouts" folder.
- Special thanks to Matt Kennedy for his help and guidance.
